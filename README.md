### Multiplayer asteroids webapp hacked for DerbyHacks ###

### The Project  
The goal of this project is to use a Raspberry Pi and NodeJS to make a portable multiplayer web game. 

The raspberry pi functions as an access point, and captures all connecting traffic, routing it to the game webapp. In addition to running the server, the Pi also runs an UnrealIRCd server for ingame chat. 

This repo contains the web frontend and backend used on the server.
